# fluid-2d

A two-dimensional fluid simulation based on [*Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games*](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/847f/819a4ea14bd789aca8bc88e85e906cfc657c.pdf) (Jos Stam 2003). It is a re-implementation of an old project of mine, now implementing the fluid solver on the GPU using CUDA.

# Requirements

- CMake >= 3.09
- CUDA  >= 8.0
- SFML  >= 2.0
